# System Design Low-Level Design (LLD)

## Introduction

**Low-Level Design (LLD)** .LLD is focusing in creating low level design(classes,interaction between modules/classes), how one table is related with another table.

Unlike High-Level Design (HLD), which focuses on the architecture and overall structure, LLD zooms in on how specific parts of the system will be implemented.

LLD is closely related to the use of **design patterns**, which provide standard solutions to commonly occurring problems in software development. 

These design patterns are grouped into three main categories: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** patterns. Each category has a specific focus and helps improve code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Types of Design Patterns in LLD

### 1. **Creational Design Patterns**

Creational design patterns deal with the process of object creation. These patterns abstract the instantiation process and help manage how objects are created to improve system flexibility and reduce dependencies between classes.

### 2. **Structural Design Patterns**


Structural design patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects. They are concerned with how classes and objects are combined to form larger structures, and they help ensure that these structures are flexible and efficient.

### 3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects interact and communicate with each other. These patterns help in defining the communication patterns between objects and make these interactions flexible.
